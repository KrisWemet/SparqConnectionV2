### 3. Database Schema Design

#### Core Entity Relationships
```
Users (1) â†” (1) Couples (1) â†” (many) DailyQuestions
  â†“                â†“                    â†“
UserPsychologyProfiles  Quests    Responses
  â†“                â†“                    
CrisisEvents  Invitations
  â†“
CouplePsychologyAnalysis
```
