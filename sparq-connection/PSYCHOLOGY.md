# Psychology Framework Guide

A comprehensive guide to understanding Sparq Connection's research-based psychology framework for developers.

## üß† Overview

Sparq Connection integrates **10+ evidence-based therapeutic modalities** to create personalized relationship experiences.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

**"We build psychology-informed rituals, not features. We create therapeutic moments, not just products."**

Every feature is grounded in psychological research with citations and validated scoring algorithms. We don't guess - we measure, analyze, and recommend based on decades of relationship science.

## üî¨ How Assessments Work

### Assessment Flow
1. **Individual Assessment**: Each partner completes comprehensive assessments
2. **Scoring**: Research-based algorithms calculate individual scores
3. **Compatibility Analysis**: System analyzes couple compatibility across all modalities
4. **Recommendations**: Personalized interventions based on results
5. **Progress Tracking**: Ongoing measurement of relationship growth

### Scoring System
- **0-100 Scale**: All scores normalized to 0-100 for consistency
- **Percentile Rankings**: Scores compared to research populations
- **Clinical Thresholds**: Identify when professional help is recommended
- **Progress Tracking**: Monthly reassessments to measure growth

### Data Security
- **Encrypted Storage**: All psychology data encrypted at rest
- **Minimal Collection**: Only collect what's needed for analysis
- **No Content Storage**: Crisis detection logs metadata only
- **Professional Ethics**: Follow psychological research ethics

## ü§ù Couple Compatibility Engine

### How It Works
The system analyzes compatibility across all 10+ modalities:

```typescript
// Example compatibility calculation
const compatibilityScore = {
  attachment: calculateAttachmentCompatibility(partner1, partner2),
  loveLanguages: calculateLoveLanguageMatch(partner1, partner2),
  gottman: calculateCommunicationCompatibility(partner1, partner2),
  values: calculateValuesAlignment(partner1, partner2),
  overall: weightedAverage(allScores)
};
```

### Compatibility Factors
- **Attachment Security**: Secure partners stabilize insecure partners
- **Communication Styles**: Gottman patterns predict success/failure
- **Values Alignment**: Shared core values increase satisfaction
- **Strengths Complementarity**: Different strengths that complement each other
- **Growth Potential**: Capacity for relationship development

### Recommendations Engine
Based on compatibility analysis, the system recommends:
- **Specific Interventions**: Targeted exercises for growth areas
- **Therapeutic Modalities**: Which approaches would be most helpful
- **Professional Resources**: When to seek couples therapy
- **Strengths to Build On**: Existing relationship assets to leverage

## üìä Clinical Validation
