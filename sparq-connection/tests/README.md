# Sparq Connection - Comprehensive E2E Testing Suite

## Overview

This comprehensive testing suite implements **evidence-based debugging** with **real browser automation** for the Sparq Connection relationship intelligence platform. Every possible user journey has been mapped and tested with deep layer validation (React state → Database → Auth → UI → Styling).

## 🎯 Testing Philosophy

**"Test the deepest layer first, capture everything, prove with evidence"**

- **Real Browser Automation**: Uses Puppeteer for actual browser testing, not just code review
- **Evidence-Based Debugging**: Captures screenshots, server logs, state dumps, and performance metrics
- **Deepest Layer First**: Tests React state changes before UI styling
- **Complete Journey Coverage**: Maps every possible user path through the application

### Evidence Capture System

Every test automatically captures:
- **Screenshots**: Full page captures at key interaction points
- **React State**: Deep state dumps with component hierarchy
- **Server Logs**: Supabase API calls, authentication events, errors
- **Performance Metrics**: Load times, resource usage, network calls
- **Visual Comparisons**: Baseline comparisons for regression testing
